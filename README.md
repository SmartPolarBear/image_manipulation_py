# image_manipulation_py

A project to implement something about image manipulation in python.

## Why

I come up with this idea completely on a whim. I think I need some project to do some math, so I do this. I mainly craft
these stuff from scratch.

## Prerequisite

#### Third-party Libraries

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- PIL
